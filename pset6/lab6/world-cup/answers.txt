Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I though that 100000 would still be in
acceptable time and maybe 1000000 would took more time but not as long as it took

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 100000
