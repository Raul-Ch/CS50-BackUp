Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I thought that 100000 would still be in acceptable time, and maybe 1000000 would take more time, but not as long as it took. Similar to the sorting part of the course, as we increment the number of "data" we process, the time taken by the program will be longer.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems that 10000 simulations are sufficient if we compare the fee with the time, but I'd rather say that it may be more accurate after 100000.
