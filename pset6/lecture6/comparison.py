# Compares two strings

# Get two strings
s = input("s: ")
t = input("t: ")

# Compare strings
if s == t:
    print("Same")
else:
    print("Different")

# Notice how Python utilizes the == to be able to compare two variables. Further,
# Python allows you to compare two strings without examining strings character by character using pointers as in C.
