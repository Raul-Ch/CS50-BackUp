# Stores favorite in a variable

import csv

# Open CSV file
with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:

    # Create reader
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Skip header row
    next(reader)

    # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
    for row in reader:

        print(favorite)

    # Notice that favorite is stored and then printed. Also notice that we use the next function to skip to the next line of our reader.
