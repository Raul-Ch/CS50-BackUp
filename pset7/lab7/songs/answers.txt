// ” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year"
// If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
In "Learn More About the Audio Aura in Your Spotify 2021 Wrapped With Aura Reader Mystic Michaela" it mentions different types of colors depending on the "vibe", so for songs.db
I see a variety of rap, pop and some trap, so I infer that is loud, energetic music, with a Purple aura that mixes pretty well with orange as perse:
Purple: This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.
Orange: Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.


// Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Beacause the way I calculated the aura was by pure inferience with a quick scan and my knowleadge on the songs and artists, and not by adding up, or averaging numbers. A better way
that i found is to englobe songs into a category or type, as markers so we can sense and check first those markers to attribute an aura and then apply the adding up, averaging or other operations
dependind on the characteristics of each song
