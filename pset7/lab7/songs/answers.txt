// ” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year"
// If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
In "Learn More About the Audio Aura in Your Spotify 2021 Wrapped With Aura Reader Mystic Michaela" it mentions different types of colors deppending on the "vibe", as for songs.db

Purple: This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.
Orange: Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.
